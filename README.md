## 📌 **Business Problem**
In today’s complex geopolitical landscape, understanding the global distribution and evolution of freedom is more important than ever. Organizations, policymakers, and researchers need a clear, data-driven view of how civil liberties and political rights are progressing or regressing across the world. However, raw data alone is difficult to interpret without effective visualization. This project aims to bridge that gap.

## 🎯 **Objective of the Dashboard**
The core goal of this dashboard is to present a compelling and interactive visual narrative of the World Freedom Index. It enables:
- Clear comparison of freedom status (Free, Partly Free, Not Free) across regions and countries.
- Identification of trends in civil liberties and political rights over the years.
- Strategic insight for governments, NGOs, and global institutions to identify regions that require urgent attention.

## 📊 **Key Visuals and Descriptions**
**KPI Indicators**
- Total Countries Analyzed
- Average Civil Liberties Score
- Average Political Rights Score
- Free Countries Count
- Pearson Correlation (CL vs PR)
  
   -*Provides a quick glance at global coverage, scoring averages, and how civil liberties relate to political rights.*
